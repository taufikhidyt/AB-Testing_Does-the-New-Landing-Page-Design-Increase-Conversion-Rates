# AB_Testing
A/B testing is a fundamental methodology in data science and digital marketing allowing organizations to make data-driven decisions regarding changes in their products or services. In this project, we aim to evaluate the impact of a new website design on user engagement. User engagement is a critical metric for website performance, often measured by the amount of time users spend on the site. By comparing user behavior between the current website design (control group) and the new design (treatment group), we can determine if the redesign leads to increased engagement.

**Project Objectives**:

**Determine the Effectiveness of the New Design**: Assess whether the new website design improves user engagement compared to the old design.
