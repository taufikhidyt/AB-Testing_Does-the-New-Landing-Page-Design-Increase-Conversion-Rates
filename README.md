# AB Testing using Python
## 1. Introduction
Welcome to my AB Testing portfolio! This project aims to demonstrate my skills in designing, analyzing, and interpreting AB Testing experiments.
A/B testing is a fundamental methodology in data science and digital marketing allowing organizations to make data-driven decisions regarding changes in their products or services. In this project, we aim to evaluate the impact of a new website design on user engagement. User engagement is a critical metric for website performance, often measured by the amount of time users spend on the site. By comparing user behavior between the current website design (A: control group) and the new design (B: treatment group), we can determine if the redesign leads to increased engagement.
